# Enemy-AI-with-Adjustable-Aggression-System-with-Coroutines

I've created numerous enemy AI patterns. My first tries were not the brightest. Because I wanted to challenge myself to get better at coding, so I've written the code without any research.

That was a great training for me, but it took a lot of time and energy. Event though I learned a lot from that challenges, I always wanted to get a job in game development, so I needed to research the common technics that were used.

In my researches, I encountered the use of coroutines in simple behaviour scripts. The logic was simple: Using a while loop with "yield return null" inside of the coroutines created a mini update function for our use.

And these two are the result!
